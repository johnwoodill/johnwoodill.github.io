#### (Under Review) **Predicting Illegal Fishing on the Patagonia Shelf from Oceanographic Seascapes**

A. John Woodill, Maria Kavanaugh, Michael Harte, and James R. Watson†

Many of the world’s most important fisheries are experiencing increases in illegal fishing, undermining efforts to sustainably conserve and manage fish stocks. A major challenge to ending illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is improving our ability to identify whether a vessel is fishing illegally and where illegal fishing is likely to occur in the ocean. However, monitoring the oceans is costly, time-consuming, and logistically challenging for maritime authorities to patrol. To address this problem, we use vessel tracking data and machine learning to predict illegal fishing on the Patagonian Shelf, one of the world’s most productive regions for fisheries. Specifically, we focus on Chinese fishing vessels, which have consistently fished illegally in this region. We combine vessel location data with oceanographic seascapes – classes of oceanic areas based on oceanographic variables – as well as other remotely sensed oceanographic variables to train a series of machine learning models of varying levels of complexity. These models are able to predict whether a Chinese vessel is operating illegally with 69-96% confidence, depending on the year and predictor variables used. These results offer a promising step towards preempting illegal activities, rather than reacting to them forensically.

#### (Under Review) **Anticipating Illegal Maritime Activities from Anomalous Multiscale Fleet Behaviors**

James R. Watson and A. John Woodill

Illegal fishing is prevalent throughout the world and heavily impacts the health of our oceans, the sustainability and profitability of fisheries, and even acts to destabilize geopolitical relations. To achieve the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal of "Life Below Water", our ability to detect and predict illegal fishing must improve. Recent advances have been made through the use of vessel location data, however, most analyses to date focus on anomalous spatial behaviors of vessels one at a time. To improve predictions, we develop a method inspired by complex systems theory to monitor the anomalous multi-scale behavior of whole fleets as they respond to nearby illegal activities. Specifically, we analyze changes in the multiscale geospatial organization of fishing fleets operating on the Patagonia Shelf, an important fishing region with chronic exposure to illegal fishing. We show that legally operating (and visible) vessels respond anomalously to nearby illegal activities (by vessels that are difficult to detect). Indeed, precursor behaviors are identified, suggesting a path towards pre-empting illegal activities. This approach offers a promising step towards a global system for detecting, predicting and deterring illegal activities at sea in near real-time. Doing so will be a big step forward to achieving sustainable life underwater.

#### (Under Review) **Optimal spraying and harvesting strategies to combat CBB in Hawaii: A Dynamic Approach**

A. John Woodill, Stuart T. Nakamoto, Andrea Kawabata, and PingSun Leung

This paper considers optimal decisions coffee farmers make to combat damage from the
coffee berry borer in Hawaii. We model the decision to spray or not spray a biological
insecticide, Beauveria bassiana, based on the expected damage from not spraying versus the
cost to spray. If damages are greater than the cost to spray, then it is beneficial to spray in
order to mitigate damage to coffee. To estimate economic damage, we use a Markov-chain
to track changes in farm-level infestation level damages temporally. The Markov-chain is
incorporated into a dynamic programming model to optimize the net-benefit during a coffee
growing season. Results provide an optimal decision path for a coffee growing season and
an optimal final net-benefit. Next, we compare our economic model against decisions from
integrated pest management strategies and decisions to always spraying or to never spray.
Results show our economic model performs best when optimizing net-benefit for a typical
farm in Kona Hawaii.

#### **Nonlinear Temperature Effects and Short-Run Adaptation of the Dust Bowl Region during the 1930s**####

A. John Woodill

The Dust Bowl of the 1930s was one of the most significant environmental events in American history.
Understanding the short-run adjustments from major weather events on agricultural yield can shed light on
the economic impacts of changing weather conditions. Nonlinear temperature effects are examined in the
Great Plains region of the US from 1910 - 1960 to identify changes in corn yield and short-run adaptation.
Results show the Dust Bowl region had more harmful temperatures than the Northern Great Plains, but
the temperature effect on corn yields were similar in each region; however, total corn yields from 1910-1960 were less in the Dust Bowl region. Nonlinear estimation results show slight adaptation in the Dust Bowl region and no adaptation in the Northern region. Adaptation appears to be limited in the short-run even with the introduction of hybrid corn and changing farming practices. Precipitation also appears to play less of a role on crop yields. These results add a historical perspective to the issue of short-run adaptation due to extreme weather events.

#### **Adaptation and The Envelope Theorem**####

A. John Woodill and Michael J. Roberts

Many suggest that adaptation can mitigate the harmful effects of climate change on agriculture.
Not accounting for adaptation is offered as a critique of studies that estimate climate change im-
pacts by extrapolating from short-run links between crop yield and weather. However, the envelope
theorem suggests that adaptation through behavioral changes from climate can be safely ignored
because the behavior is already optimized. Therefore, adaptation is a second-order effect of extreme
events and nonlinearities. Additionally, marginal effects of weather provide an approximation for
climate responses. In this paper, we provide a simple model to show that the envelope theorem holds
across continuous and discrete crop switching decisions, which is a common adaptation mechanism
to climate change. We then carry out an empirical analysis to show that nonlinear effects without
adaptation have a negative impact on revenue-per-acre as temperatures increase, but reduced nega-
tive effects when accounting for adaptation. Additionally, we show marginal approximation without
adaptation provides a reasonable estimate of nonlinear effects with adaptation. These results sug-
gest that accounting for adaptation can be ignored in order to get useful estimates of the effects of
climate change on agriculture.

#### **Adaptation to Climate Change: Disentangling Revenue and Crop Choice Responses**####

A. John Woodill and Michael J. Roberts

Adaptation by crop-switching has been suggested as a way to mitigate the harmfull effects of climate change on agriculture. Empirically, long run impact studies focus on cross-sectional associ- ations between agricultural outcomes and prevailing climate, implicitly accounting for adaptation; but the adaptive mechanism is not clear and the relationships may be confounded by unobserved factors. In this paper, we use a long history of crop choice and productivity outcomes to estimate effects of both weather and climate for major field crops in the United States. The approach lever- ages historical differences in climate trends across U.S. counties, differences that are large enough to span anticipated climate changes over the next 50 years, even after removing state-level trends. Climates are defined by backward-looking rolling means of the weather measures, with lag length selected via cross-validation. We then estimate the effect of climate change from a base level to uniform increases in temperature from 0-5°C. We find adaptation slightly reduces impacts relative to estimates that consider weather alone.
