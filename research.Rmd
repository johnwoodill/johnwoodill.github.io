####**Nonlinear Temperature Effects and Short-Run Adaptation of the Dust Bowl Region during the 1930s**####

The Dust Bowl of the 1930s was one of the most significant environmental events in American history.
Understanding the short-run adjustments from major weather events on agricultural yield can shed light on
the economic impacts of changing weather conditions. Nonlinear temperature effects are examined in the
Great Plains region of the US from 1910 - 1960 to identify changes in corn yield and short-run adaptation.
Results show the Dust Bowl region had more harmful temperatures than the Northern Great Plains, but
the temperature effect on corn yields were similar in each region; however, total corn yields from 1910-1960
were less in the Dust Bowl region. Nonlinear estimation results show slight adaptation in the Dust Bowl
region and no adaptation in the Northern region. Adaptation appears to be limited in the short-run even
with the introduction of hybrid corn and changing farming practices. Precipitation also appears to play less
of a role on crop yields. These results add a historical perspective to the issue of short-run adaptation due
to extreme weather events.
