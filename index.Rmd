&emsp; I am currently a post-doctoral researcher at Oregon State University in the College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Science under the supervision of Dr. James R. Watson. I am currently interested in studying illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) events in the oceans to identify anomalous multiscale fleet behavior that will allow us to detect illegal maritime activities. Using tools from complex systems and information theory and tracking data from vessel transponders (AIS) we are attempting to build an index for detecting IUU events in the oceans in near real-time. This endeavor seeks to achieve the UN's Sustainable Develoment Goal 14 "Life Below Water": to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources.


&emsp; I am also a trained economist with an interest in the economic impact of climate change on agriculture. I have extensive experience modeling and predicting crop yield, revenue, and acres using historical weather/climate data (degree days and time in each degree) and farm-level data, such as available water, soil permeability, and soil class. Two of my more recent projects include building a Neural Network to predict crop yield and a Recurrent Neural Network to predict commodity prices. Much of my work as a graduate study worked on the economic impact of an invasive species to Hawaii coffee, the coffee berry borer. I continue to work on this research in order to provide farmers with important information to improve decision making on the farm.


&emsp; Aside from climate change research I am also facinated with data science and using machine/deep learning methods to uncover insights into data. Through an economic lens, I am inspired by the many ways we are able to model data to provide insight into decision making and to answer difficult questions. I love exploring new technologies in advanced analytics that now allow us to take advantage of big data and make more informed decisions.
