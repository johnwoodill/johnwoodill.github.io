&emsp; I am an interdisciplinary Environmental Economist that brings a multi-faceted approach to solving large-scale environmental issues. Before pursuing an academic career as an Economist, I served in the United States Air Force as a Civil Engineer. I have worked in-and-out of warzones, deploying to forward operating bases to support airfields and hospitals with international coalition forces. After separating from the Air Force, I pursued academics and received a PhD in Economics from the University of Hawaiâ€™i where I studied the economic impact of climate change on US agriculture. 

&emsp; I am currently a Research Associate at Oregon State University working in the [Socio-Environmental Analysis (SEA) Lab](http://jrwatson.ceoas.oregonstate.edu/about/)  under the supervision of James R. Watson in the College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences. I use advanced analytics in computer science and econometrics to address complex environmental problems that span several disciplines, such as resource, agriculture, and fisheries economics, complex systems, oceanography, earth-systems, ecology, and entomology.  

&emsp; When I am not prototyping new models, I enjoy catching an early morning surf, a round of golf when the surf is flat, a long run with an interesting podcast, or playing improvised music.
