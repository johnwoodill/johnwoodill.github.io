I'm currently a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Economics at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa. My primary research interest focuses on the economic impact of climate change on agriculture. I have extensive experience modeling and predicting crop yield, revenue, and acres using historical weather/climate data (degree days and time in each degree) and farm-level data, such as available water, soil permeability, and soil class. I'm also familiar with machine/deeping learning methods. Two of my more recent projects include building a Neural Networks to predict crop yield and a Recurrent Neural Networks to predict commodity prices.

Check out the links at the top of the page to learn more about my interests and experiences.
